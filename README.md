# DeepLearning_FinalProject

Task 1:
- Implementing a MLP of two layers to predict the final point of learning curves given some hyperparameters configurations as in input to the network
- Implementing a baseline (Random Forest) to compare results
- Hyperparameter tuning (Random Search)

Task 2:
- Implementing a RNN with two LSTM layers, and two MLP layers for predicting the learning curve given fixed number of epochs (timesteps)
- Implementing a RNN with two LSTM layers, and two MLP layers for predicting the learning curve given random number of epochs  - varying input lenghts(timesteps)
- Implementing a baseline (Random Forest) to compare results
- Hyperparameter tuning (Random Search)
